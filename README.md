# Advent of Code 2024

It's that time of the year again! 🎄🎅🎁. I'm excited to solve the Advent of Code 2024 in Haskell this year. 

I've used the template from [Martinsos](https://github.com/Martinsos/aoc-2023-haskell-template).

## Setup

You are expected to have `ghcup` installed on your machine.

Run `./ghcup-set.sh` to set the intended version of GHC, cabal and HLS via GHCup.

If any of the versions needed are not yet installed on your machine, you can use `ghcup tui` to install them.

It might work with other combination of versions also, but this combo works for sure.

If all is good, `cabal build` should complete successfully for you.

See more instructions in the [original README](https://github.com/Martinsos/aoc-2023-haskell-template/blob/main/README.md).
